**Portals** is a library for dealing with asynchronous event-driven architecture in two ways. The first is the run-of-the-mill event bus with a different way of handling context. The second provides a way of declaring services with multiple endpoints for those that don’t like the “ping-pong” concept in all cases; endpoints are tappable, lockable, and securable.
